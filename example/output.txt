Retext

See Browser Support for more information (a.k.a. don’t worry about those
grey icons above).

Hey all! First, thanks a lot for watching, starring, and forking retext!
Secondly, I wanted to invite you all to leave any feedback or issues you
might have, to help me make retext even cooler :smile:.
retext is an extensible natural language system—by default using
parse-latin to transform natural language into a TextOM object model.  Retext provides a pluggable system for analysing and manipulating natural
language in JavaScript, NodeJS, and the browser. Tests provide 100% coverage
cloud HTML5.

Rather than being a do-all library for Natural Language Processing
(e.g., NLTK or OpenNLP), retext aims to be useful for more practical
use cases (such as censoring profane words or decoding emoticons, but
the possibilities are endless) instead of more academic goals (research
purposes). retext is inherently modular—it uses plugins (similar to
rework for CSS) instead of providing everything out of the box (e.g.,
Natural). This makes retext a viable tool for use on the web.
